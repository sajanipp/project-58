		<h1>Hi!</h1>
		<div class="line"></div>
		<p>If you happen to be looking for a hobby that gets you moving, provides some exercise and can be a fun experience, taking up cycling could be the answer for you.
			It really doesn’t matter how old you are, or if you boy, girl, man or woman, it’s a sport and a hobby that any person at any age can enjoy.

			Another great thing about taking up cycling as a hobby is that you can do it on your own time and schedule, and cycle as much or as little as you are able to.

			Other than some up front costs for equipment and for the bicycle itself, it’s also a very cost-effective hobby that can be fun and also provides some valuable exercise you may not get with other hobbies.

			So if you’re interested in taking up cycling, here are some important things you’ll need to know.</p>
			<br>
	<h2>Getting Started:-</h2>	<br>

		<p>Obviously, you’ll need to select a bicycle for the type of riding you think you’ll do. Ask yourself if you will just be riding on roads or streets or possibly doing some off-road biking.


		Once you have that answer, it would make sense for you to visit a bike shop where they can guide you in choosing the right bike for your needs.



		A standard road bike will work for street riding, a mountain bike is better for off-road use, or a hybrid if you’ll be doing a little of both.

		They can also help decide on a frame that works best for you. This can depend on your size, weight, etc. A bike that is too big or too small can actually have a negative effect on your body.</p>
<br>
		<h2>Learn the Basics:-</h2><br>

		<p>If cycling is a new hobby for you, get familiar with the basics of riding. These include braking, changing gears, making turns and peddling. Take things slowly at first with shorter rides until you feel more and more comfortable.</p>
